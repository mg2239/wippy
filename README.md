# wippy

A problem I've noticed is when artists want to share unreleased music, whether it be to share with friends, submit to a label, or share for a feedback stream, there's potential for the song to be accessed by unwanted people if the URL is leaked or sent to others. wippy tries to solve this issue by hosting songs temporarily. When uploading a song, users can have the link expire after a certain amount of time (and in the future, after a certain number of plays).

## Features
 - No account needed
 - Up to 15MB mp3 uploads
 - Expire time can be from minutes to days
